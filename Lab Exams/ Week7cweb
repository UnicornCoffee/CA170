#We will get a script called "cweb" working. This script goes through your web pages, changing one string to another string. 
Instead of doing an "ls" of the file $file:

    Print out the contents of the file with "cat".
    Send that via a pipe to "sed" (like above).
    Note that "sed" should change the old string to the new string, whatever they are. It should not just be hardwired to change Scotland to Finland.
    Redirect the output to a temporary file.
    So the line is:

     cat ... | sed ... > tmpfile

    You fill in the dots.
    Use "cp" to copy the temporary file back to the original file. 

1 #!/bin/bash
2 
3 # Read in the arguments:
4 OLDSTRING=$1
5 NEWSTRING=$2
6 
7 # the following gets rid of the first two arguments
8 shift
9 shift
10 
11 # from now on, "all arguments" means "all arguments from 3rd one on"
12 # go through all arguments one by one:
13 
14 for file in $*
15 do
16  ls -l $file 
17  cat $file | sed -e "s|$OLDSTRING|$NEWSTRING|g" > tmpfile
18  cp tmpfile $file
19 done
